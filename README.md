# Kaizen OBS
An OBS Websocket controller made in Godot
## About
Kaizen OBS is an android app made in Godot 4, which will provide complete control over OBS through Websockets, custom scripting, and a simple configuration GUI.
## The goal
Kaizen OBS is intended to be a competitor to [OBS Blade](https://github.com/Kounex/obs_blade) and [TouchPortal](https://www.touch-portal.com/), however it is not meant to compete with the elgato Stream Deck.\
Kaizen OBS is planned to have an intuitive GUI, and configuration system, with the ability to write custom OBS websocket scripts if needed.\
As well Kaizen OBS will hopefully feature an advanced plugin system to add integrations to other programs in the future.
## FAQ
- Q: Why did you start another project instead of continuing work on one you already have?
	- A: As I have multiple projects, and am always looking to expand my portfolio, I will consistently work on 2 or 3 projects at a time, but mostly because I wanted to work on something a bit different for awhile.
